# RetroPie-Backup
An app for backing up RetroPie to your PC.

## Installation

Download and run the latest version (**RetroPie Backup.exe**).

## Dependencies

**WinSCP** ("C:\Program Files (x86)\WinSCP\WinSCP.exe")

## Setup

Before use you must have a SCP session already created in WinSCP that connects successfully to your RetroPie.

Below is an example of a session for the RetroPie.

The following Advanced Settings should also exist for this session.

In the **WinSCP Settings** panel ensure the following:

- **Hostname** is the same as the "Host name" field in your WinSCP session
- **Username** is the same as the "User name" field in your WinSCP session
- **Password** is the same as the "Password" field in your WinSCP session
- **Host Key** is the key generated by WinSCP for your session (see WinSCP "Session -> Generate Session URL/Code" menu item)

In the **Paths to Synchronise** panel setup any number of local and remote paths to be synchronised, from the RetroPie (Remote) to your PC or attached device (Local).

- **Local** paths are those locations local to your computer (ie. C:\\..., D:\\..., E:\\..., F:\\... etc)
- **Remote** paths are those locations on the RetroPie (ie. /boot/..., /home/..., /opt/...)
- **File Mask** is an optional mask for specifying which files are (or aren't) synced from the Remote Paths (see WinSCP File Masks)
- **Include** is a checkbox that is set to indicate the path will be included for synchronisation

When **WinSCP Mirror** is clicked the synchronisation (backup) process begins.  Only those paths with **Include** checked will be synchronised.  Files are only synchronised (mirrored) from the Remote paths to the Local paths.

A Windows console will display during the backup process.  When the console closes the process has finished.

## Troubleshooting

A log of the backup process is created in the same folder as "RetroPie Backup.exe" and is named **RetroPie Backup.log**.

Issues or errors will be logged to this file.
